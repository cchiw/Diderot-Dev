The log-gen tool generates the event-logging infrastructure from
a description in the ../log-events.json file.  The generated code
includes

	src/lib/include/diderot/log-events.hxx
	src/lib/include/diderot/logging.hxx

The file ../log-events.json includes a description of the specification-
file format.
