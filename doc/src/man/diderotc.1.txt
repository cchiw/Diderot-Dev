NAME
----
diderotc - compiler for the parallel domain-specific language Diderot


SYNOPSIS
--------
*diderotc* ['OPTIONS'] 'FILE'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The diderotc(1) command compiles Diderot source code into either a library
(the default) or a stand-alone executable.
The Diderot language is a parallel domain-specific language for image-analysis
algorithms that supports a high-level mathematical programming model based
on the differential tensor calculus.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h, --help*::
  Display a list of command-line options and then exit.
  This list includes additional options used to support development and debugging of
  the compiler.

*-H*::
  Display a list of *all* of the command-line options and then exit.  This list
  includes compiler controls that are meant for debugging the compiler.

*--version*::
  Show the compiler version and exit.

*--about*::
  Show information about the Diderot language and compiler and then exit.

*--exec*::
  Compile the Diderot program to run as a standalone executable.

*-o, --output*='OUTFILE'::
  Use the name 'OUTFILE' as the stem for the generated code files.
  When coupled with the *--exec* flag, 'OUTFILE' will be the name of
  the executable.

*--namespace*='PREFIX'::
  Specify a namespace prefix for generated interface to the Diderot program.
  The default namespace prefix is \texttt{Diderot}.

*--snapshot*::
  Generate code to get a snapshot of strand states (ignored if the *--exec* flag is given).

*-g*, *--debug*::
  Enable assertions and debugging information in the generated code and runtime system.

*--double*::
  Use double-precision floating-point for the Diderot real type.

*--longint*::
  Use 64-bit integers for the Diderot real type.

*--scalar*::
  Do not generate vectorized code (*i.e.*, code that uses the **gcc* vector extensions).

*--log*::
  Emit a log file of the compiler's intermediate representations.
  This option is mainly used to debug the compiler.

*--stats*::
  Collect and report statistics about optimizations, etc.

*--verbose*::
  Print messages to stderr as each compiler stage starts and ends.

*--target*='TARGET'::
  Specify the target platform for the generated code.
  The *diderotc* compiler currently supports the following choices for 'TARGET':
+
--
  *sequential*;;
    single-threaded sequential implementation.
  *parallel*;;
    parallel implementation for shared-memory multiprocessors using pthreads.
  *opencl*;;
    parallel implementation for GPUs using OpenCL (if supported).
  *cuda*;;
    parallel implementation for GPUs using CUDA (if supported).
--
+
Note that not all targets are supported by all installations.  Use the *--help* command to
determine the targets supported by a given instance of the compiler.


OUTPUT FILES
------------
The *diderotc* compiler produces one or more output files, depending on the command-line
options.
These files will have a common stem, which will either be the stem of the source file (i.e.,
'foo' for the source file 'foo.diderot') or the name specified by the *--output* option.


RUNTIME OPTIONS
---------------
  The executables produced by the compiler when using the *--exec* option recognize
  a number of standard options.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
  Enable runtime-system messages to standard error.

*-t*, *--timing*::
  Report execution time to standard output.

*-l 'NUM'*, *--limit 'NUM'*::
  Specify the limit on the number of super-steps taken by the program to 'NUM'
  (0 means unlimited). The default is unlimited.

*-s 'NUM'*, *--snapshot 'NUM'*::
  Generate a snapshot of the strand state after every 'NUM' super-steps.  This option is
  only present if both the *--snapshot* and *--exec* options were given to the compiler.

*-print* 'FILE'::
  Specify where to direct printed output.  The default is standard output.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

*DIDEROT_TEEM_DIR*::
  If this environment variable is present, it is used to specify the path
  to the Teem installation.
  The *diderotc* compiler uses this path to find teem executables, libraries, and include
  files that are used during the compilation process.
